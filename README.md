# Electricity System Matrices (PTDF, PSDF, LODF)
Calculation of relevant system matrices for electricity network modeling in GAMS:
- PTDF - power-transfer-distribution-factors
- PSDF - phase-shifting-distribution-factors
- LODF - line-outage-distribution-factors
based on network topology and technical characteristics. The general procedure is
applied to a simplified three-node network with identical characteristics.
